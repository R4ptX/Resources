Boring cryptography refers to the idea that cryptographic systems should be easy to use and hard to misuse, making them less complex and more accessible for developers.
Many important Cryptography libraries like OpenSSL are written in C. With the advances of technology we now have languages like Rust. With its built-in safety features 
and the ability to write safeer and more predicatable code. Rust's ownership and borrowing system ensures memory safety by preventing null pointer dereferencing and memory leaks at compile time, which can be crucial for cryptographic operations that require strict adherence to constant-time execution to avoid side-channel attacks.
