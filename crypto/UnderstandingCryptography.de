Higly recommended book for an easier introduction to the topic of Cryptography. The book is written by Christof Paar, a professor at the Ruhr University Bochum in Germany and his lectures follow the book. The link to Youtube is on the website. 

You can read the book first to get a high-level understanding and watch the lecture(s) afterwards, which often covers the topics in more detail. Or you watch the lecture(s) first and read the chapters in the book afterwards as a summary.
